#Spring Fundamentals
*Form Model Binding*

##Notes:


#Exercise:
1. Refactor your PostController and create form to implement form model binding.


2. Create a controller method and HTML template for viewing a form to edit a specific post.


3. This method should map to /posts/{id}/edit.


4. When you view this page, the form should be pre-populated with the values from an existing post.

*BONUS*

You'll notice that the forms for creating and editing a post are almost entirely the same. How could you refactor your code to avoid duplication?
